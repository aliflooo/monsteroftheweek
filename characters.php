							<p>"He admired The Sybil for the work they did until one mystery brought them to his hometown of Lone Pine. There, he discovered that another string of disappearances was happening similar to the ones when he was a child. He learned that a force called The Hunger was stealing the souls of townspeople to bestow the power to see ghosts to another person who will act as the guardian of Lone Pine. Realizing that this was the role he should have served, Wilhelm promised himself that he wouldn't run away anymore."</p>

							<p>"Cody is a self proclaimed “regular guy,” but it quickly becomes apparent that a lot about him is out of the ordinary. His quick wit, aptitude for magical tech, willingness to learn, and his loyalty to his new friends make him an essential member of the team - even if he can’t throw a punch. Cody is 1000% sure that with this rag tag group of magic users is the place he needs to be. It’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to him, after all. But as time goes on he starts to realize why it’s important that The Weird stay a secret, and, when their story draws to a close, that out there there’s a home for him other than his parent’s house."</p>

							<p>Erin is an Oracle.  Or, more specifically, an oracle-in-training.  She uses her Tarot cards that she made herself in order to read the future.  She grew up in an orphanage in North Carolina, and after being kicked out, discovered her abilities.  From there, she went with the Oracles to train and hone her skills, and after she got a little better, was sent off to find the rest of the Monster of the Week crew.  While she hasn't been around long, she has proven her worth among this band of misfits. She recently learned she might be even more powerful than she was told before, and that she has the power within herself, if only she could figure out what to do with it.  Her mission was originally to stop the crew from messing with the Veil further, but after talking with Artemis, now feels a sense of freedom in getting to make choices for herself.</p>
