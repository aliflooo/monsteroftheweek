							<p>Erin has short, wavy black hair (about shoulder length), with bangs that cover her right eye.  Her left eye is brown, while her right eye is gold (as a result of the Veil being torn open).  She stands at 5'4", and she has a few freckles scattered on her face.  She wears all black, typically a black T-shirt, black jeans, and black ear piercings.</p>

							<p>Erin is an Oracle.  Or, more specifically, an oracle-in-training.  She uses her Tarot cards that she made herself in order to read the future.  She grew up in an orphanage in North Carolina, and after being kicked out, discovered her abilities.  From there, she went with the Oracles to train and hone her skills, and after she got a little better, was sent off to find the rest of the Monster of the Week crew.  While she hasn't been around long, she has proven her worth among this band of misfits.  She can use magic, and has in order to trap people in place, erase memories of others, heal her friends, and even help tackle powerful enemies.  But her real magic skill lies in fortune telling.</p> 

							<p>She has had dreams, visions, and omens displayed to her with her abilities, and has helped stop several bad things from happening.  She tries her best, but sometimes her readings don't give her enough information, due to her training still taking place.  She recently learned she might be even more powerful than she was told before, and that she has the power within herself, if only she could figure out what to do with it.  Her mission was originally to stop the crew from messing with the Veil further, but after talking with Artemis, now feels a sense of freedom in getting to make choices for herself.</p>
