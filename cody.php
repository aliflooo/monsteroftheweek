							<p>Cody is an undeclared community college student (and Papa John’s employee) who still isn’t quite sure what he wants out of life. On the side, Cody runs a weekly radio show called Monster Of The Week, where he researches and discusses cryptids, conspiracies and mysteries. Having heard that a speaker at his community college has ties to a recently disappeared cult in Wyoming, he decides to investigate himself at their meeting. Here he meets the other party members. Realizing that working with this strange group of individuals could answer his questions about the cult, The Weird, and the world, he asks to join them as they road trip across America.</p>

							<p>As he embarks on this journey, the focus of Cody’s show turns into a documentation of his experiences with the group (with the names changed of course). The fans that call in seem to think that it’s a creative writing project - and can’t get enough of trying to solve the mysteries along with him. One such fan is Cody’s long time friend, Reece. They met just before High School, through a random encounter over HAM radio - a hobby they both share. Reece has been his closest (and only) friend since that time, and when things get stranger and stranger, he becomes a much needed confidant for Cody.</p> 

							<p>Cody is a self proclaimed “regular guy,” but it quickly becomes apparent that a lot about him is out of the ordinary. His quick wit, aptitude for magical tech, willingness to learn, and his loyalty to his new friends make him an essential member of the team - even if he can’t throw a punch. Cody is 1000% sure that with this rag tag group of magic users is the place he needs to be. It’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened to him, after all. But as time goes on he starts to realize why it’s important that The Weird stay a secret, and, when their story draws to a close, that out there there’s a home for him other than his parent’s house.</p>
