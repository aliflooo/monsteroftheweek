							</div>
							<p>Wilhelm is a rising senior at the University of Kansas studying Biology. He was born in Lone Pine, Colorado which is a small commuter town with a train line running into Denver. He grew up with his mother, father, older sister, and grandma. Following a string of disappearances throughout the town when he was 9 years old he suddenly began seeing ghosts and monstrous looking creatures around his town. If they realized that they could see him, they would follow him and try to talk to him. As he got older, he got better and better at ignoring them and eventually lost the ability to hear them. However, the one ghost he was unable to ignore was that of his grandmother who died during his senior year of high school. This was what led him to move so far away for school, so he could escape the guilt of doing nothing for her spirit.</p>
							<p>He was one of the original members of the group assembled by The Sybil to fight monsters across the US to maintain the Veil between the Normal and the Weird. When he first started he was indecisive and would be too slow to make decisions. As him and his friends grew closer together over time he began to realize that he couldn't afford to sit and wait for someone else to act or those dear to him could be hurt. This led to him acting more impulsively and putting himself in harm's way, but his ability to be somewhere when something bad is about to happened helped prevent many disasters.</p>
							<p>He admired The Sybil for the work they did until one mystery brought them to his hometown of Lone Pine. There, he discovered that another string of disappearances was happening similar to the ones when he was a child. He learned that a force called The Hunger was stealing the souls of townspeople to bestow the power to see ghosts to another person who will act as the guardian of Lone Pine. Realizing that this was the role he should have served, Wilhelm promised himself that he wouldn't run away anymore.</p>
